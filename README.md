# Leo's Bass Guitar Shop Front-end, in jQuery

This is a front-end for the [Leo's Bass Guitar Shop](https://github.com/seg-leonelsanches/leos-music-shop-api-python), API written in Python.

## Motivation

As this project uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, it is perfect to test GTM instrumentation.

Differently from other PoCs, this one doesn't emit events from its source code, but from GTM tags and triggers.
